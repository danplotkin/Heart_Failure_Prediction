# Heart_Failure_Prediction

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally. CVDs account for 31% of all deaths worldwide (17 million deaths per year). Heart failure is a common event that is caused by CVDs.

In this project, I am using R to demonstrate how to use 12 predictor variables to predict whether or not a patient will die from heart failure. To do this, I am using Logistic Regression and Random Forest models to find the optmimal model between the two.
